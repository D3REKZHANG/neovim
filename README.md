# neovim-config

My Neovim configuration! Feel free to copy it over and play around with it.

Notable key rebinds:
- `<space>` as leader key makes custom keybinds so easy to hit. (i.e. `<space>w` for `:w`) 
- `n -> b` and `m -> n` for easier reach and better ergonomics (assuming touch typist resting right hand on `jkl;`)
- `q -> %` since I jump brackets very often (q is easy to hit with left pinky)

Notable plugins:
- `vim-smoothie` makes scrolling with `<ctrl-d> <ctrl-u>` usable
- `vim-floaterm` is a really clean floating terminal within vim

Requires Vim Plug as a plugin manager.
