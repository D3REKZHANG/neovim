# neovim-config

My Neovim configuration! Feel free to copy it and play around with it.

I started using Vim/Neovim in fall 2020 (CS 1A) when I bought a 60% mechanical keyboard with no arrow keys lol.

## Notes
Favourite Plugins
- `nvim-tree` is a super fast tree written in lua with nice aesthetics (also has sidebar offset feature which is huge)
- `vim-floaterm` is a really clean floating terminal within vim
- `vim-smoothie` makes scrolling with `<ctrl-d> <ctrl-u>` usable

Notable Rebinds:
- `<space>` as leader key makes custom keybinds so easy to hit. (i.e. `<space>w` for `:w`) 
- `n -> b` and `m -> n` for easier reach and better ergonomics (assuming touch typist resting right hand on `jkl;`)
- `q -> %` since I jump brackets very often (q is easy to hit with left pinky)
