# neovim-config

My Neovim configuration! Feel free to copy it and play around with it.

I started using Vim/Neovim in Fall 2020 (CS 1A) when I bought a 60% mechanical keyboard with no arrow keys lol.

## Notes
Favourite Plugins
- `nvim-tree` is a super fast tree written in lua with nice aesthetics (also has sidebar offset feature which is huge for that traditional ide feel)
- `telescope` clean fuzzy finder for file navigation (think vscode ctrl-p)
- `vim-airline` awesome status bar that's easily customizable and has lots of themes from `vim-airline-themes`
- `vim-smoothie` makes scrolling with `<ctrl-d> <ctrl-u>` usable
- `coc.vim` Language server for autocompletion, go-to-definition, etc. Looking to switch to native Neovim LSP soon

Notable Rebinds:
- `<space>` as leader key makes custom keybinds so easy to hit. (i.e. `<space>w` for `:w`) 
- `0 ^` so that 0 jumps to the first non whitespace character of the line (I find 0 easier to hit than shift+6)
- `q -> %` since I jump brackets very often (q is easy to hit with left pinky)

Also has full mouse support (scroll, can open files from tree, close buffers in the tabline, etc). I know this is an anti-pattern, but its nice to scroll around with the mouse sometimes and it's also convenient when others want to use my computer.
